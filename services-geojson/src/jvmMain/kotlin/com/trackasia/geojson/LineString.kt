/**
 * A linestring represents two or more geographic points that share a relationship and is one of the
 * seven geometries found in the GeoJson spec.
 *
 *
 * This adheres to the RFC 7946 internet standard when serialized into JSON. When deserialized, this
 * class becomes an immutable object which should be initiated using its static factory methods.
 *
 *
 * The list of points must be equal to or greater than 2. A LineString has non-zero length and
 * zero area. It may approximate a curve and need not be straight. Unlike a LinearRing, a LineString
 * is not closed.
 *
 *
 * When representing a LineString that crosses the antimeridian, interoperability is improved by
 * modifying their geometry. Any geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by
 * cutting it in two such that neither part's representation crosses the antimeridian.
 *
 *
 * For example, a line extending from 45 degrees N, 170 degrees E across the antimeridian to 45
 * degrees N, 170 degrees W should be cut in two and represented as a MultiLineString.
 *
 *
 * A sample GeoJson LineString's provided below (in it's serialized state).
 * ```json
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "TYPE": "LineString",
 *   "coordinates": [
 *     [100.0, 0.0],
 *     [101.0, 1.0]
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 * Look over the [Point] documentation to get more
 * information about formatting your list of point objects correctly.
