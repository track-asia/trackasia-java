 * bounding box instance is being created. Note that since GeoJson objects only have the option of
 * including a bounding box JSON element, the `bbox` value returned by a GeoJson object might
 * be null.

 * At a minimum, a bounding box will have two [Point]s or four coordinates which define the
 * box. A 3rd dimensional bounding box can be produced if elevation or altitude is defined.
