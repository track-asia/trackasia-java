/**
 * A point represents a single geographic position and is one of the seven Geometries found in the
 * GeoJson spec.
 *
 *
 * This adheres to the RFC 7946 internet standard when serialized into JSON. When deserialized, this
 * class becomes an immutable object which should be initiated using its static factory methods.
 *
 *
 * Coordinates are in x, y order (easting, northing for projected coordinates), longitude, and
 * latitude for geographic coordinates), precisely in that order and using double values. Altitude
 * or elevation MAY be included as an optional third parameter while creating this object.
 *
 *
 * The size of a GeoJson text in bytes is a major interoperability consideration, and precision of
 * coordinate values has a large impact on the size of texts when serialized. For geographic
 * coordinates with units of degrees, 6 decimal places (a default common in, e.g., sprintf) amounts
 * to about 10 centimeters, a precision well within that of current GPS systems. Implementations
 * should consider the cost of using a greater precision than necessary.
 *
 *
 * Furthermore, pertaining to altitude, the WGS 84 datum is a relatively coarse approximation of the
 * geoid, with the height varying by up to 5 m (but generally between 2 and 3 meters) higher or
 * lower relative to a surface parallel to Earth's mean sea level.
 *
 *
 * A sample GeoJson Point's provided below (in its serialized state).
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "type": "Point",
 *   "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0]
 * }
 * ```
