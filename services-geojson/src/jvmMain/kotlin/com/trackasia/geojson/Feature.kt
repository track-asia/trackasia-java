/**
 * This defines a GeoJson Feature object which represents a spatially bound thing. Every Feature
 * object is a GeoJson object no matter where it occurs in a GeoJson text. A Feature object will
 * always have a "TYPE" member with the value "Feature".
 *
 *
 * A Feature object has a member with the name "geometry". The value of the geometry member SHALL be
 * either a Geometry object or, in the case that the Feature is unlocated, a JSON null value.
 *
 *
 * A Feature object has a member with the name "properties". The value of the properties member is
 * an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).
 *
 *
 * If a Feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be included as a member of
 * the Feature object through the [.id] method, and the value of this member is either a
 * JSON string or number.
 *
 *
 * An example of a serialized feature is given below:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "TYPE": "Feature",
 *   "geometry": {
 *     "TYPE": "Point",
 *     "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
 *   },
 *   "properties": {
 *   "prop0": "value0"
