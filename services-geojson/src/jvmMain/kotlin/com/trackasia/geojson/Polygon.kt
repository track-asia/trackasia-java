/**
 * This class represents a GeoJson Polygon which may or may not include polygon holes.
 *
 *
 * To specify a constraint specific to Polygons, it is useful to introduce the concept of a linear
 * ring:
 *
 *  * A linear ring is a closed LineString with four or more coordinates.
 *  * The first and last coordinates are equivalent, and they MUST contain identical values; their
 * representation SHOULD also be identical.
 *  * A linear ring is the boundary of a surface or the boundary of a hole in a surface.
 *  * A linear ring MUST follow the right-hand rule with respect to the area it bounds, i.e.,
 * exterior rings are counterclockwise, and holes are clockwise.
 *
 * Note that most of the rules listed above are checked when a Polygon instance is created (the
 * exception being the last rule). If one of the rules is broken, a [RuntimeException] will
 * occur.
 *
 *
 * Though a linear ring is not explicitly represented as a GeoJson geometry TYPE, it leads to a
 * canonical formulation of the Polygon geometry TYPE. When initializing a new instance of this
 * class, a LineString for the outer and optionally an inner are checked to ensure a valid linear
 * ring.
 *
 *
 * An example of a serialized polygon with no holes is given below:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "TYPE": "Polygon",
 *   "coordinates": [
 *     [[100.0, 0.0],
 *     [101.0, 0.0],
 *     [101.0, 1.0],
 *     [100.0, 1.0],
 *     [100.0, 0.0]]
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
